# Build a Web Page Test

## Overview

In `designs.zip` there are PSD's for each of the following breakpoints:

 - 320
 - 768
 - 992

## Instructions

 - Build the designs using HTML & CSS
 - The page must be responsive. (Tip: Start with mobile)
 - You can use a CSS framework. The designs were created with [Bootstrap's](http://getbootstrap.com/) default grid system in mind, but feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with.
 - The design makes use of 2 font families:
 	- Roboto (Can be found [here](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto))
 	- Georgia (Assume it is available on the user's system)
 - Each PSD has a grid layer that you can use to see the column structures within the design. The PSD's also contains "layer comps" for the normal and hover states of various elements.
 - For your convenience, all the image assets required to build this page have been saved into the `image-assets` directory
 - We will be judging your submission based on:
 	- Elegance of your CSS and HTML
 	- Accuracy of your build relative to the designs (We'll be checking your build across multiple browsers)


## Deliverables

All assets/files needed to build and view the page in a browser.
